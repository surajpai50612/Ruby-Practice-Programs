# Loops- if we want to iterate some statements many no. of times we use loops
# Types- for, while, until, times, each

# for i in 1..10 do
#     puts "Hello World!- #{i}"
# end

# for i in 1..10 do
#     if i%2==0
#         puts i
#     end
# end

# for i in 1..10 do
#     if i%2==1
#         puts i
#     end
# end

# array=[1,2,3,4,5]

# for i in array do
#     puts i
# end

# array=["suraj","madhav","rakshan","gautham","shivathmaj"]

# for i in array do
#     puts i
# end

# x=1

# while x<11
#     puts x
#     x+=1
# end

# until- is opposite of while loop 
# x=1
# max=10

# until x>max
#     puts x
#     x+=1
# end

# times- can only be used with integers

# 10.times {
#      puts "Hello" 
# }

# OR

# 10.times do
#      puts "Hello" 
# end

# each- used primarily with arrays and hashes

# array=["suraj","madhav","rakshan","gautham","shivathmaj"]

# array.each do |i|
#     puts i
# end

# array=["suraj","madhav","rakshan","gautham","shivathmaj"]

# array.each { |i|
#     puts i
# }
